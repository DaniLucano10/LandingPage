              DUAL DEGREES WITH THE BACHELOR IN DATA AND BUSINESS ANALYTICS

            <Text>
              The Dual Degrees at IE University offer students the opportunity to
              graduate with two bachelorâ€™s degrees by completing an additional
              year of academic studies. These prestigious programs are a great
              option for students who want to focus their careers in two distinct
              yet connected fields of study. By combining two diverse subject
              areas, our Dual Degree students develop a multidisciplinary profile,
              enabling them to play important roles in solving complex global
              issues where boundaries between disciplines continue to disappear
